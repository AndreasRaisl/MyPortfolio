# MyPortfolio
finally trying out some real  Web Development.

This is a website, telling you something about myself, my professional background and my hobbies. It uses a bunch of different web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL so far. 
And actually, this is the main purpose: practicing web development and showing at what point of my journey I am at the moment. 

It s not attempting to show a professional level. And it's features won t be always of big use for the real world. It is full of trial and error. Because that s the way for me how to learn and show off honestly where I am.
